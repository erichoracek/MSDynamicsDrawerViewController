The Extended Objective-C library extends the dynamism of the Objective-C programming language to support additional patterns present in other programming languages (including those that are not necessarily object-oriented).

libextobjc is meant to be very modular â€“ most of its classes and modules can be used with no more than one or two dependencies.

Please feel free to open issues for feature requests or ideas for language extensions (even if you have no idea how they'd work)!

# Features

libextobjc currently includes the following features:

 * **Safe categories**, using EXTSafeCategory, for adding methods to a class without overwriting anything already there (identifying conflicts for you).
 * **Concrete protocols**, using EXTConcreteProtocol, for providing default implementations of the methods in a protocol.
 * **Simpler and safer key paths**, using EXTKeyPathCoding, which automatically checks key paths at compile-time.
 * **Compile-time checking of selectors** to ensure that an object declares a given selector, using EXTSelectorChecking.
 * **Easier use of weak variables in blocks**, using `@weakify`, `@unsafeify`, and `@strongify` from the EXTScope module.
 * **Scope-based resource cleanup**, using `@onExit` in the EXTScope module, for automatically cleaning up manually-allocated memory, file handles, locks, etc., at the end of a scope.
 * **Algebraic data types** generated completely at compile-time, defined using EXTADT.
 * **Synthesized properties for categories**, using EXTSynthesize.
 * **Block-based coroutines**, using EXTCoroutine.
 * **EXTNil, which is like `NSNull`, but behaves much more closely to actual `nil`** (i.e., doesn't crash when sent unrecognized messages).
 * **Lots of extensions** and additional functionality built on top of `<objc/runtime.h>`, including extremely customizable method injection, reflection upon object properties, and various functions to extend class hierarchy checks and method lookups.

The [experimental](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/libextobjc/tree/experimental)
branch contains additional features that may be interesting, but are not
considered stable or safe for production use. Check out the headers for more
information.

# Running tests

To execute libextobjc's tests, first run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
to bring in the [xcconfigs](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/xcconfigs) submodule,
then open the project file and choose the desired test target.

# Adding to your project

If you want to add libextobjc as a dependency to an **application**, add the
repository as a [submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules),
then include the source files you care about in your Xcode project.

If you want to add libextobjc as a dependency to a **framework or library**,
prefer [subtree merging](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging),
which will allow you to rename symbols to avoid conflicts, and make any tweaks
you need to for your library.

To create a libextobjc subtree:

```
$ git remote add libextobjc https://github.com/jspahrsummers/libextobjc.git
$ git fetch libextobjc
$ git read-tree --prefix=External/ -u libextobjc/master
$ git reset
```

Rename any symbols or change whatever you want, `git add` the specific files
that you want in your library, and then add them to your Xcode project.

To bring in upstream changes later:

```
$ git fetch -p libextobjc
$ git merge -Xsubtree=External/ libextobjc/master
$ git reset
```

Then, again, just add the changes you want.

# Requirements

libextobjc must be built with ARC enabled, and many of its macros require ARC in the calling files as well. MRR usage is not supported.
