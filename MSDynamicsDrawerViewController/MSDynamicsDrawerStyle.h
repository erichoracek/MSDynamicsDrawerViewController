/**
 `MSDynamicsDrawerStyle` is a protocol that defines the interface for an object that can style a `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController`. Instances of `MSDynamicsDrawerStyle` are added to `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController` via the `addStyle:forDirection:` or `addStyles:forDirection:` method.
 
 ## Creating a Custom Style
 
 As user interacts with the instance of `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController`, the style class is messaged via the method `dynamicsDrawerViewController:didUpdatePaneClosedFraction:forDirection:`, which allows the style to changes attributes of the `drawerView` or `paneView` relative to the paneClosedFraction.
 
 It's recommended that custom styles don't change the `frame` attribute of the `paneView` or the `drawerView` on the `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController` instance. These are constantly modified both by the user's gestures and the internal dynamic animator within `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController`. The behavior of `MSDynamicsDrawerViewController` when the frame is externally modified is undefined.
